# Cursor Traveler Extension - Comprehensive Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the complete migration strategy for the Cursor Traveler Chrome extension, transforming it from a legacy RxJS-based extension to a modern, high-performance extension using Effect.

## Project Goals

1. **Reactive Library Migration**: Replace RxJS with [Effect](https://effect.website) for better type safety, error handling, and performance
2. **Functional Programming Migration**: Replace Ramda with Effect's built-in functional programming capabilities
3. **Build System Modernization**: Replace Webpack with Vite for faster development and builds
4. **Manifest V3 Compliance**: Upgrade to Chrome Extension Manifest(latest version as for 2025) for future compatibility
5. **Universal Measurement System**: Add support for any configured measurement system (Imperial, scientific, fantasy) alongside metric system

## Current State Analysis

### Technologies in Use
- **Reactive Programming**: RxJS 6.3.1 (background scripts, content scripts, storage handling)
- **Functional Programming**: Ramda 0.25.0 (data transformation, conversion logic)
- **Build System**: Webpack 4.17.3 with custom configuration
- **Extension Manifest**: V2 (deprecated, will be disabled soon)
- **TypeScript**: 3.1.1 (significantly outdated)
- **Testing**: Jest with minimal coverage
- **Measurement System**: Metric only (centimeters, meters, kilometers) with hard-coded conversion logic

### Key Components Using RxJS & Ramda
- `src/background/index.ts`: Message handling and storage operations
- `src/content/index.ts`: Mouse movement tracking with buffering, Ramda sum function
- `src/popup/index.tsx`: Real-time UI updates, Ramda pipe for data transformation
- `src/utils/getFromStorage.ts`: Chrome storage abstraction
- `src/utils/eventMessage.ts`: Inter-component communication
- `src/utils/converter.ts`: Heavy Ramda usage (pipe, cond, curry, multiply, etc.)
- `src/utils/total.ts`: Ramda pipe, sum, values for data aggregation
- `src/utils/plural.ts`: Ramda cond, lte, always for conditional logic
