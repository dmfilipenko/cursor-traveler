# Cursor Traveler Migration Documentation

This folder contains comprehensive documentation for migrating the Cursor Traveler Chrome extension from RxJS to Effect, along with modernizing the entire technology stack.

## ðŸ“‹ Documentation Index

### 1. [Migration Plan](./migration-plan.md)
**The master plan** - Complete 8-week migration strategy covering all aspects of the transformation:
- Phase-by-phase breakdown
- Technology stack modernization  
- Timeline and deliverables
- Risk assessment and mitigation
- Success metrics

### 2. [Effect Migration Guide](./effect-migration-guide.md)
**Technical deep-dive** - Practical examples and patterns for migrating from RxJS to Effect:
- Concept mappings (Observable â†’ Effect/Stream)
- Real code migration examples
- Error handling improvements
- Resource management patterns
- Testing strategies

### 3. [Universal Measurement System](./universal-measurement-system.md)
**Feature specification** - Comprehensive implementation plan for a universal measurement system:
- Configuration-driven architecture supporting any measurement system
- Pre-configured systems: metric, imperial, scientific, astronomical, fantasy
- TypeScript-based configuration for type safety
- Service integration with Effect architecture
- Extensible design for future measurement systems

## ðŸŽ¯ Migration Goals

### Primary Objectives
1. **Reactive Library**: Replace RxJS with [Effect](https://effect.website) for superior type safety and error handling
2. **Functional Programming**: Replace Ramda with Effect's built-in functional programming capabilities
3. **Build System**: Modernize from Webpack to Vite for 10x faster builds
4. **Extension Platform**: Upgrade to Chrome Extension Manifest V3
5. **Measurement System**: Implement universal measurement system supporting multiple unit systems

### Benefits Expected
- **Developer Experience**: Faster builds, better debugging, type safety
- **User Experience**: More robust error handling, better performance
- **Future-Proofing**: Modern tech stack, Chrome Web Store compliance
- **Feature Enhancement**: Universal measurement system supporting multiple unit configurations

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### For Developers
1. Read the [Migration Plan](./migration-plan.md) for overall strategy
2. Study [Effect Migration Guide](./effect-migration-guide.md) for technical patterns
3. Follow phase-by-phase implementation

### For Reviewers
1. Review the comprehensive [Migration Plan](./migration-plan.md)
2. Examine technical approach in [Effect Migration Guide](./effect-migration-guide.md)
3. Validate universal measurement system requirements in [Universal Measurement System](./universal-measurement-system.md)
